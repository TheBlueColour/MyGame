## Abstract 

My goal is to create a Unreal Engine 3D game, focusing on the style of platformer with inspiration being Sonic games. My plan is to create a platformer where the task is to collect a certain amount of coins before reaching the end goal and finishing the game. You play as a little creature avoiding spike enemies that try to damage you and traverse moving platforms, disapearing platforms, wall jumping and springs. 

My Goals:
    A Moving Actor in the form of moving platforms around the map that the player has to traverse over, the platforms can range from ones that move on the x-axis or on the y-axis. As well as disapearing platforms once you stand on them that reapear after a certain amount of time.
